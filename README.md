# datawork

Cover in Workshop 1
APIs (application programming interface) - online communication portals that allow you to access data from organisations
your code < - > API < - their code/data
I've got a working example with Temboo
Workout accessing via Google Spreadsheet Plugin

Pre-gathered datasets
Github (i.e. Machine Learning datasets, be aware that datasets contain bias! they are not objective i.e. talk about 3 black teenagers Google Search or Manet and Burrito) ALL data is biased
Kaggle
Make your own

Searching text corpus’
See Daniel Shiffman for online tutorials: https://shiffman.net/a2z/text-analysis/
I've modified the Concordance example so it searches and counts words and then you can output a csv file

You can also web scrape your own datasets together
Everest Pipkin - talks about how scraping your own datasets allows you to be more careful, ethical and tactical in where you source data from and who you seek to represent (and how they are represented) in datasets
“Scraping is perfect for data that is ungathered, under-respected, or generally lacks the resources to be bundled into a set; data that is “floating.”
But remember no dataset is 'neutral'

Shiv Integer
http://www.plummerfernandez.com/Shiv-Integer
"Shiv Integer is a bot making assemblage art for 3D printers. Rummaging through Thingiverse, the biggest online 3D-Print community and a vast archive of user-made models - full of knick-knacks and engineering parts - the bot picks objects at random to conjoin into sculptures and gives them apt word-salad names such as "disc on top of an e-juice golf." The process follows a lineage of Dadaist readymade and chance art, but also explores the authorship-inheritance of Creative Commons licensing, as well as performing an archiving of an Internet subculture, taking cross-database snapshots of 3D-Print culture.

The bot ran anonymously with only a vague FAQ explanation. Thingiverse users either love or hate the bot; it’s provoked hundreds of comments ranging from fan poetry to hate mail, and sparked a long debate over if it makes art or spam. User’s binding stake in authorship made them fiercely active, forming a key facet of Shiv Integer, which from the outset was an anagram of Thingiverse."

Mitchel Whitelaw's [Climate Coasters](http://mtchl.net/climate-coasters/), [Measuring Cup](http://mtchl.net/measuring-cup/) and [Climate Bracelet](http://mtchl.net/weather-bracelet/).
More examples of physical, tangible design informed by data. How would these object perform if they were put next to others of their category? Would a Climate Coaster in a pub stimulate discussion?

[Balance](http://www.marcelhelmer.de/) by Marcel Helmer. Using the natural balance of physical options to visualise the friction between action on pollution and personal investment in the matter.

[SMS to Paper Planes](https://www.christiangross.info/en/sms-to-paper-airplanes/) by Christian Gross. Visualising text messages sent in a long distance relationship. Each message informs the direction, size and amount of folds in each plane. Using blank paper keeps the text content private while still expressing the emotional value of each message through folds. Also good example of data sourcing from your own digital self.
