# Data Work

## Data Scraping

In the first workshop we will look at scraping text and image data from the web and text corpuses. Included in this 'datawork' GitHub repository are a number of example techniques and files that you can scaffold off and use in your own collection and structuring of datasets.

When working with data be aware that all datasets are situated within and produced through broader socio-material practices. This means that all data sets are biased no data set is objective or neutral.

## API Example / Twitter API & Google Sheets
Many online platforms allow you to access their online datasets and services using an API (Application Programming Interfaces). You can think of APIs as translators that allow your code to talk to and their code. See here for a list of APIs https://any-api.com/.

'Twitter Archiver' is a Google Sheets Add-On that allows you to access and search for tweets on Twitter. 

* You will need a Twitter Account
* Log in to Google Drive (you probably have one via your UTS email). 
* Go to Sheets and create a new sheet
* Select the Add-Ons menu and then Get Add-Ons
* Search for "Twitter Archiver" and then click the Free button. A pop up will come up and follow the prompts. You will need to authorise Twitter Archiver to access your Twitter account.
* Go to Add Ons > Twitter Archiver > Create Rule

### How to Search
If you are not sure what you would like to search for you can test it out using the hashtag associated with a widescale event or movement such as the School Climate Stike (#strikeforclimate #climatestrike) or metoo (#metoo). We suggest also constraining your search in some way, for example by date. As an example if you just searched for 'cats' with no other constraint you will receive all tweets that include that word. To constrain by date you will need to a more advanced search options using any of Twitter's search options in the Advanced Rules box. Add -filter: since:2019-01-01 to search all dates from the start of the year until now. And you can also add -filter: until:2019-31-01 if you wanted to constrain all the result to only the month of January.

## Pre-gathered Datasets
You can also use datasets that have also been collated or gathered. Kaggle has over 15,000 

Github (i.e. Machine Learning datasets, be aware that datasets contain bias! they are not objective i.e. talk about 3 black teenagers Google Search or Manet and Burrito) ALL data is biased
Kaggle
Make your own

Searching text corpus’
See Daniel Shiffman for online tutorials: https://shiffman.net/a2z/text-analysis/
I've modified the Concordance example so it searches and counts words and then you can output a csv file

You can also web scrape your own datasets together
Everest Pipkin - talks about how scraping your own datasets allows you to be more careful, ethical and tactical in where you source data from and who you seek to represent (and how they are represented) in datasets
“Scraping is perfect for data that is ungathered, under-respected, or generally lacks the resources to be bundled into a set; data that is “floating.”
But remember no dataset is 'neutral'

Shiv Integer
http://www.plummerfernandez.com/Shiv-Integer
"Shiv Integer is a bot making assemblage art for 3D printers. Rummaging through Thingiverse, the biggest online 3D-Print community and a vast archive of user-made models - full of knick-knacks and engineering parts - the bot picks objects at random to conjoin into sculptures and gives them apt word-salad names such as "disc on top of an e-juice golf." The process follows a lineage of Dadaist readymade and chance art, but also explores the authorship-inheritance of Creative Commons licensing, as well as performing an archiving of an Internet subculture, taking cross-database snapshots of 3D-Print culture.

The bot ran anonymously with only a vague FAQ explanation. Thingiverse users either love or hate the bot; it’s provoked hundreds of comments ranging from fan poetry to hate mail, and sparked a long debate over if it makes art or spam. User’s binding stake in authorship made them fiercely active, forming a key facet of Shiv Integer, which from the outset was an anagram of Thingiverse."
